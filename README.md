## Overview

The Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring System is designed to offer a pain-free alternative to traditional blood glucose meters and continuous subcutaneous monitors. By using an LED light and a photoresistor placed on either side of a finger, the device measures light absorption changes through the tissue. This information is then processed with machine learning algorithms to determine glucose levels and track lifestyle factors that influence blood sugar.

## Background

Traditional glucose monitoring methods are invasive and can be particularly challenging for elderly patients and those with chronic conditions like diabetes. This project is driven by the need for a non-invasive solution that:
- Reduces discomfort and pain associated with finger pricking or implanting sensors.
- Provides continuous, real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels.
- Integrates actionable insights based on lifestyle data to better manage diabetes.

## Features

- **Non-Invasive Sensing:** Uses optical methods to measure glucose levels without breaking the skin.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Delivers instantaneous glucose readings and trend analysis.
- **AI-Assisted Analysis:** Machine learning models analyze the sensor data for accurate glucose estimation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Displays current levels, historical trends, and personalized recommendations.
- **Portable & Ergonomic Design:** Compact design optimized for ease-of-use, especially for elderly users.

## Hardware Components

- **LED Light Source:**
  - Selected for its stability and suitable wavelength (e.g., near-infrared) that interacts with interstitial fluid.
- **Photoresistor/Photodiode:**
  - Sensitive enough to detect variations in transmitted light after passing through the finger.
- **Signal Conditioning Circuitry:**
  - Includes amplification and filtering stages to manage noise and ambient light interference.
- **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):**
  - High-resolution ADC for accurate digitization of sensor data.
- **Microcontroller/Embedded System:**
  - Handles data acquisition, controls the LED, and interfaces with the machine learning software.
- **Ergonomic Finger Clip:**
  - A custom-designed housing ensuring consistent sensor placement and reliable measurements.

## Software Components

- **Data Acquisition Module:**
  - Interfaces with hardware to collect and preprocess sensor data.
- **Signal Processing Algorithms:**
  - Noise reduction and baseline correction techniques to improve data quality.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:**
  - Feature extraction from optical data.
  - Model training using regression techniques and neural networks to predict glucose levels.
  - Real-time inference integrated into the embedded system.
- **User Interface:**
  - Displays real-time glucose levels, historical trends, and alerts for hypo- or hyperglycemia.
- **Data Logging & Analytics:**
  - Stores historical data for trend analysis and further model refinement.

## Design & Methodology

The system design is based on a non-invasive optical measurement technique:
1. **Optical Sensing:**
   An LED light shines through the finger while the photoresistor on the opposite side measures light attenuation. Variations in light absorption are influenced by glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid.
2. **Data Processing:**
   The raw sensor output is conditioned and digitized. Signal processing algorithms filter noise and account for variables such as ambient light.
3. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   A trained model correlates the processed optical data with actual blood glucose levels. Continuous learning allows the system to adapt to individual user characteristics.
4. **User Feedback:**
   A user-friendly interface presents the measured glucose levels, trends, and personalized health recommendations, aiming to support effective diabetes management.

## Setup & Installation

### Hardware Setup

1. **Assemble the Device:**
   - Mount the LED and photoresistor on opposite sides of the custom finger clip.
   - Connect the signal conditioning circuit and ADC to the microcontroller.
